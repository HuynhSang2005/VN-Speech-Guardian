# HTTP Version Analysis for VN-Speech-Guardian MVP

## Current Performance (HTTP/1.1)
```csv
Metric                | Current | Target | Status
---------------------|---------|---------|--------
Response Time (p95)  | 64ms    | <100ms | ✅ GOOD
CPU Usage           | <3%     | <40%   | ✅ GOOD  
Memory Usage        | 283MB   | <1GB   | ✅ GOOD
Concurrent Users    | 3       | 3      | ✅ MATCH
```

## HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 Decision Matrix

### MVP Phase (Current - 3 months)
| Factor | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 | Winner |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Docker compose | SSL + reverse proxy | HTTP/1.1 |
| **Performance** | 64ms sufficient | ~40ms potential | Draw |
| **Debugging** | curl/browser tools | More complex | HTTP/1.1 |
| **Deployment** | Any hosting | HTTPS required | HTTP/1.1 |
| **Development Speed** | Fast iteration | SSL setup delays | HTTP/1.1 |

**MVP Decision: HTTP/1.1 ✅**

### Scale Phase (3-6 months, 10+ users)
| Factor | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 | Winner |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Connection Limit** | 6 per domain | Unlimited multiplexing | HTTP/2 |
| **Latency** | Connection overhead | Shared connections | HTTP/2 |
| **Server Push** | Not supported | Push partial results | HTTP/2 |
| **Infrastructure** | Established | Added SSL complexity | HTTP/1.1 |

**Scale Decision: HTTP/2 consideration ⚖️**

## Recommended Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
- Keep HTTP/1.1 + chunking strategy
- Focus on: AI model accuracy, UX polish, error handling
- Performance target: <100ms p95 ✅ (currently 64ms)

### Phase 2: Scale (Later)
- Add HTTPS/SSL infrastructure  
- Upgrade to HTTP/2 for connection multiplexing
- Add Server-Sent Events for real-time partials
- Performance target: <50ms p95

## Connection Optimization (HTTP/1.1)

Current implementation có thể optimize:

```typescript
// apps/gateway-nestjs/src/modules/ws/ai-worker.service.ts
private readonly httpAgent = new Agent({
  keepAlive: true,           // Reuse connections
  keepAliveMsecs: 3000,     // Keep alive 3s
  maxSockets: 5,            // Limit per endpoint
  maxFreeSockets: 2,        // Pool idle connections
});
```

## Performance Monitoring

Track these metrics for HTTP version decision:
- Connection establishment time
- Request queuing time  
- Concurrent connection count
- Memory usage per connection

## Conclusion

HTTP/1.1 là choice tối ưu cho MVP:
- Faster development velocity
- Simpler deployment pipeline
- Performance đã đáp ứng target
- Easy debugging & monitoring

HTTP/2 upgrade when:
- 10+ concurrent users
- Complex SSL infrastructure sẵn sàng
- Performance bottleneck proven
